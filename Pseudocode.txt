Pseudocode:

private List<Map<String, List<Album>>> genreBlocks;
private Set<String> knownGenres;

For each line in the input file
    Let song be a new Song object with the line information
    If song is not null
        Let genre be a new string equal to song's get genre method
        If genre is not null and not empty
            If knownGenres set does not contain genre
                Add genre to knownGenres
                Let newMap be a new map object that maps strings to lists of Album objects - let it's name be the value of the genre object's value.
                Let newAlbum be a new Album object (arguments are the song and song's get album name method)
                Set newMap's key to genre's value
                Set newMap's value to newAlbum
            else
