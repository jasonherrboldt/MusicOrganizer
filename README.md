# MusicOrganizer
###Description
(Under construction.) This is a coding exercise I made up to sharpen and demonstrate my Java skills. It's a command line driven program that reads a list of songs from a file, organizes them by genre, and prints the organized song list to another file. 

The user may elect to sort the songs within each genre by title, by artist, by song title, by album, or by song length, either all ascending or all descending. (Default sorting is by artist, then by album, then by album track, then by song title, then by song length, all ascending.) The user may also request a random playlist of any length (up to the input length) to be printed after the sorted list. 

###Details, Assumptions, and Requirements

Genre blocks are sorted by genre name, with an extra line break between blocks. For example, all alternative songs will be listed first, followed by all electronic songs, followed by all jazz, etc. (User may elect to sort genre blocks in either ascending or descending order.) 

When songs are sorted by album, songs by the same artist with no associated album should come after all other albums by the same artist if ascending, or before if descending. 

Must be able to successfully handle compilations, i.e. songs with various artist names and song titles that belong to the same album. (Does not need an album artist name.) 

Tracks within the same album with no track numbers should be ordered by track name. If an album has both numbered and non-numbered tracks, non-numbered tracks should always come last, either when ascending or descending.

Test cases are nice, but not required -- the sorted output file will be verification enough.

A user may specify the initial sorting within a genre, as well as the ascending / descending order. Secondary, tertiary, etc. sorting will be decided by the program. If an ascending / descending choice is not made, the default choice will be ascending. See the examples below. (The first row is the default, the 1st column is the field the user can change, then all other columns programatically follow.)

Album track sorting should always be ascending, irrespective of the selected overall ordering. 

The random playlist must randomly select songs from the entire list, including album tracks. 

Each comma-separated line of the input file should be in this format: [artist], [song title], [album title (may be left out)], [album track number (a unique positive integer) (may be left out)], [genre], [song length (must be of the form MMSS, eg 244)]. 

Command line usage: 

* input_filename [the name of the input file to use (no path = current path)]
* output_filename [the desired name of the output file (no path = current path)]
* -sortby [valid arguments are artist, album_title, song_title, and time (can only be one)]
* -sortorder [valid arguments are ascending and descending (can only be one)]
* -random [the length of the random playlist to print]

Exceptions for these cases should be logged to the console. All are fatal unless otherwise specified: 

- an input file line without all of the following: an artist, a song title, a genre, and a time -â€“ album title and track are optional (ok to log, ignore, and continue);
- a requested random playlist of length strictly less than 1 or strictly greater than the number of songs on the input file;
- an invalid song length, e.g. 376 (ok to log, ignore and continue);
- unable to open input file;
- unable to read input file.

An example input file example is located in the root directory (input_file.txt). It has full albums, singles, and one or two incomplete lines that should be ignored by the program.
